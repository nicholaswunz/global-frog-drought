## Abstract
Maintaining water balance is a critical attribute influencing the resilience of organisms to climate extremes such as drought events. The risk of drought may also be mediated by ecological types, or ecotype that differ in their microhabitat preference and dependence on water, and thus their physiological niche. Using anurans, a data-rich taxonomic group, we identified regions of exposure risk to increase aridity and drought, and examined which ecotypes were most sensitive to desiccation using biophysical simulations to quantify changes in activity in relation to climate change. Under a business-as-usual scenario, we show that ~24% of areas occupied by anurans will increase to arid-like conditions, and 38% of areas will be at risk of drought...
